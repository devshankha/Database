#A good example of a database join
select employee.Name from employee JOIN orders ON employee.employeeid = orders.employeeid where employee.Name="David";

#Another example of a database join
select fname from employees JOIN offices on employees.officecode = offices.officecode where offices.country="USA";




#Another example, here the above sql join is replaced with an inner query

#select fname from employees JOIN offices on employees.officecode = offices.officecode where offices.country="USA";
